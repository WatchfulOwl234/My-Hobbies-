        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is art. I love art because it cools my mind from hard work at school and it is really fun and easy to do. I decorate my bedroom walls with the art that i make, which makes me sincerely happy to do. Me and my little sister do it together and it has really strengthened our friendship. I even invite some of my friends to come over and paint with us so that we can have some company. Its really fun and is one of the reasons why art is one of my favorite things to do </p>
